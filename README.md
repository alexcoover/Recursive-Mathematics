# Recursive-Mathematics

Mathematic functions in Java using only recursive methods.

eduodd:
	 * The method returns a value which: - Increases each of even decimal digits of
	 * n by one - Decreases each of odd decimal digits of n by one
fibby:
	 * return 1 when n = 0 - return sum of
	 * fibby(floor(n/4)) and fibby(floor(3n/4)) when n > 0
 stg:
  	 * The method prints all consecutive values of n and its fibby value
 median3:
    *  Takes an array of integers and splits it into three equal arrays, then takes the median of the each array,
    * before finally returning the medain of the 3 medians.
